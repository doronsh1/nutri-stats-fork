# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add email notification functionality to alert administrators when new users register with the application. The system will send a simple email notification containing basic user registration information to a configured admin email address whenever a new user successfully completes the registration process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to receive email notifications when new users register, so that I can monitor user growth and be aware of new registrations in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user successfully completes registration THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the configured admin email address
2. WHEN the email notification is sent THEN it SHALL include the new user's email address and registration timestamp
3. WHEN the email notification fails to send THEN the system SHALL log the error but NOT prevent the user registration from completing
4. WHEN the admin email address is not configured THEN the system SHALL skip sending notifications without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure the email notification settings, so that I can control where notifications are sent and customize the email content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring email settings THEN the system SHALL support setting an admin notification email address
2. WHEN configuring email settings THEN the system SHALL support SMTP server configuration for sending emails
3. WHEN email configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the situation without breaking registration
4. WHEN the notification email is sent THEN it SHALL have a clear subject line indicating a new user registration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email notification system to be reliable and not impact user registration performance, so that user experience remains smooth even if email delivery has issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending email notifications THEN the system SHALL process them asynchronously to avoid blocking user registration
2. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN all email retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue normal operation
4. WHEN the email service is unavailable THEN user registration SHALL still complete successfully
